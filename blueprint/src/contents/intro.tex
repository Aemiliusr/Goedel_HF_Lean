\section{Introduction}
This document is made using the Blueprint tool of Patrick Massot, which enables the creation of a 
human-readable web page (with accompanying pdf) of the proof, which is connected to the Lean formalisation.
Please refer to \url{https://aemiliusr.github.io/Goedel_HF_Lean/blueprint/} for the corresponding web page.
My current focus is on writing the blueprint — which eventually will form my thesis — starting with
the appendices of \cite{swierczkowski2003finite}.

Revisiting the first appendices of the paper allows me to refine the coding I did when I was first learning Lean. 
This includes shortening proofs and improving the API. 
By doing this, I hope to make my code Mathlib-worthy (though whether the content is Mathlib-worthy is another question). 
I am fairly certain that I won't be able to fully prove Gödel's first incompleteness theorem in Lean for my thesis. 
Instead, I aim to pave the way for its completion by creating a project that only requires
work done in a forward manner without needing to fix or rewrite existing code.
My goal is to write up the mathematics leading up to and including the first incompleteness theorem using the Blueprint tool — 
presenting all the theory in a clear, structured, and formalisable way — and to formalise as much of this theory as possible. 
The formalised parts will be marked with a check on the Blueprint web page.

This introduction was written for the preliminary report and will, of course, be revised for the thesis.
