\noindent This work describes a formalisation of Gödel's first incompleteness theorem
for the first-order theory of hereditarily finite sets using the Lean theorem prover.
In particular, the work follows the developments by \cite{swierczkowski2003finite},
who provided proofs for both incompleteness theorems.
Hence, completing the formalisation of Gödel's first incompleteness theorem through 
\cite{swierczkowski2003finite} naturally leads to the second incompleteness theorem.
As of now, there does not exist a formalisation of both incompleteness theorems in Lean.
Although this work does present a complete proof of the first incompleteness theorem,
the formalisation has not been finished yet. 
However, what remains should be relatively straightforward to complete; 
the blueprint of this project contributes to such possible further developments.
