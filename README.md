An ongoing project to formalise Gödel's incompleteness theorems using hereditarily finite set theory in the Lean theorem prover. The work closely follows S. Swierczkowski's 'Finite Sets and Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems'. Dissertationes mathematicae. IM PAN, 2003. URL https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5BQZAQAAIAAJ. 

# Information about the project

The project is being run by Ruben Reijerse under the supervision of Kevin Buzzard; it currently serves as a master's thesis at Imperial College London. Furthermore, Jujian Zhang is an active contributor.

For more details about the proof and the first-order theory of hereditarily finite sets, a good place to start is the [paper](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5BQZAQAAIAAJ) by Swierczkowski and the [blueprint](https://aemiliusr.github.io/Goedel_HF_Lean/blueprint/).
